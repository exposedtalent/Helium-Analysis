# Helium-Analysis
This is the repo for python scripts to analyze and display the data coming in from helium hotspots. 
All of the scripts are running on AWS Serverless Lambda Functions which get their data from Dyanamodb Tables. Using JavaScript and HTML I designed a front end which integrated with the AWS Lambda functions.
