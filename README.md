# Helium Dashboard

Created a dashbaord using AWS services stated below. The dashboard showed the users the earnings and allowed users to track health of [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) hotspots. Designed and built a deep analysis engine to analyze activity and predict rewards for hotspots. Used AWS DynamoDB for storage, python-based lambda and API Gateway for backend, JavaScript for frontend, and AWS Cognito for user authentication and role-based access control.

AWS services used : 
- Lambda (Created the back and front end)
- Cognito (User authentication)
- Dynamodb (Database)
- API Gateway (Created an REST API connected with the database)
- CloudWatch (Scheduled events)
